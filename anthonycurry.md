<p> I chose to write about Incorrect Default Permissions. Essentially, what this means is that when you install or share a file that you plan on sharing, the installed file permissions are set publically so that anyone may modify the files. This is a security and integrity risk as this would lead people to do what they wanted with said file. </p>
<p> For example, one CVE that was recorded was when a Standard security setting for Mandrake-Security package installed home directories with world-readable permissions. This would give every single user the ability to read each others files without restriction. Another example would be when the default permissions of `/dev/kmem` in Linux allowed IP spoofing. </p>
  <p> Personally, the most common mistake I make is forgetting to change the file permissions of my private keys. Whenever I acquire a key and put it inside of a file, I forget to run the command `chmod 600 [filename]` before I SSH into an envirnment. I have been lucky and the machine warns me that the file permissions are too open but I have made it a good habit to remember to change the permissions every time. </p>
